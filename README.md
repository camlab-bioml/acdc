### ACDC for CyTOF data processing ###

This is a Python 3 implementation of methods used in "Automated cell type discovery and classification through knowledge transfer", a automated method for analyzing CyTOF data

### Setup ###
* Dependencies
    * This package was tested in Python 3.5
    * scikit-learn >0.18.0
    * scipy
    * third-party package [Phenograph](https://github.com/jacoblevine/PhenoGraph)


* Installation
    * Currently, simply put the ACDC folder in the same place where the python script is executed
